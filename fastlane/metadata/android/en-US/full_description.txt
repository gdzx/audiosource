<i>Audio Source</i> forwards Android microphone audio input to the PulseAudio daemon through ADB, so you can use your Android device as a USB microphone.

<b>Requirements:</b>

* Device with at least Android 4.0 (API level 14), but fully tested only on Android 10 (API level 29) so your mileage may vary.
* GNU/Linux machine with:
    * Android SDK Platform Tools (requires adb in PATH).
    * PulseAudio or PipeWire with PulseAudio support (requires pactl in PATH).
    * Python 3 (requires python3 in PATH).

For further details, see the project's documentation.
